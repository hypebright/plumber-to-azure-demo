This repo was made to demonstrate how to host a R Plumber API using Azure App Service.

In todays world, web services have become a common language for allowing systems to interact with one another. R is one of my favourite programming languages and it's especially good at data processing, modeling, and visualisation. One way to share your R code with the world is by transforming your R code into a web service. The [plumber R package](https://plumber.io) is the tool to do that: it allows users to expose existing R code as a service available to others on the Web.

While developing a R plumber web service (aka API) is straightforward, there are various ways to host an API. There is no one correct way to do it, most often the choice depends on your existing infrastructure and your specific use case. This repo and accompanied article guide you through the steps to host a very basic plumber API using Azure App Service [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/services/app-service/).
